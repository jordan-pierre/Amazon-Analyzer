# Amazon-Analyzer
Amazon analyzer tool designed for Amazon FBA sellers.

## Description
Reads a CSV of products available from distributors and their prices.  Scrapes amazon.com for relevant details about those products such as title, sales price, shipping size, number of sellers, whether or not Amazon sells it, etc., calculates profitability of the product at current list price, and returns the details in a new CSV.

## Future State
Host online and display results on a website.

## UPDATE
Amazon realized the program is a bot and redirects to a page with a Captcha rather than the product page.  Web scraping method isn't sustainable--would have to connect directly to Amazon's database for $$$.
